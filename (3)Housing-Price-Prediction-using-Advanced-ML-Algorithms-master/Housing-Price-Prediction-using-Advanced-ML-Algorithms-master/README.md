# Housing-Price-Prediction-using-Advanced-ML-Algorithms
Predicting housing price of King County, Washington DC using various Regression techniques and comparing the algorithms based on the    precision calculating parameters.

In this project, I am predicting the House price of the houses using various machine learning algorithms. Housing sales price are determined by numerous factors such as area of the property, location of the house, condition of the property, age of the property, number of bedrooms and bathrooms and so on. This project uses machine learning algorithms to build the prediction model for houses. Here, machine learning algorithms such as XG-Boost, Light-GBM, Random Forest Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Multiple Linear Regression and KNN are employed to build a predictive model. I have considered housing data of 21613 properties. Cat Boost Regressor, XG-Boost , Gradient Boosting Regressor, Light-GBM, Random Forest Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree Regression , Multiple Linear Regression, Ada Boost Regressor and KNN  show the R-squared value of 0.911,0.903,0.909,0.903,0.888, 0.882,0.813, 0.80, 0.739, 0.690 ,0.687, 0.811 respectively. Further, I have compared these algorithms based on parameters such as mean of the R-squared values obtained by the k-Fold Cross Validation, Adjusted R-Square, R-Square and RMSE. This project also represents significance of my approach and the methodology.

### Minor Thesis
In our research, we are predicting the selling prices of dwellings in King County, Washington DC by applying various Machine Learning algorithms for improving dwelling market interpretation and appraisal of differentiating among market value and market price. The dataset considered in our case study contains dwelling data of 21613 properties as well as contains 20 analytical features. In past various linear based and non-parametric algorithms are used for forecasting real estate price but are ineffective in observing anomalies in the data. Therefore, we used ensemble-based algorithm like Random Forest and deep learning-based algorithm like Neural Networks to perform a comparative analysis against the typical used algorithms like Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression and K Nearest Neighbors. We further performed Deep Data Exploration using Histogram, Pair Plot Visualization and Correlation among features during Data Analysis for understanding behavioral nature of the data. Comparative analysis was performed based on various performance metrics such as k-Fold Cross Validation, Adjusted R-Square, R-Square and Root Mean Square Error. According to the performance metrics considered for dwelling price prediction, Random Forest outperforms compared to other models and can be further used in order to help buyers and sellers make better decisions based on dwelling price valuation.

### Major Thesis
The domain of dwelling prediction is historically done by exploiting typical linear regression methods, however the relationship among price and property features exhibits complexity as well as non-linearity, which are not handled robustly by the existing research. Therefore, in our study, variety of advance regression techniques are introduced, including a series of ensemble models which have the capability to learn non-linear data, handle outliers and can strongly predict residential prices. In the paper, we considered an open-source data record that includes 20 descriptive attributes and 21,613 records of property transactions in King County, USA from May 2014 to May 2015. Data Pre-processing, feature engineering, data normalisation, standardisation and exploratory data analysis are conducted on our data to form a structured, correlative and complete dataset to be used in training and testing. Further, the tuning of ensemble models is enforced by exploiting hyperparameters to boost the accuracy. Finally, our experiments conclude that the Cat-Boost algorithm, resulted in an accuracy of 91.45 % that outperforms other models by a close proximity while doing manual tuning of parameters whereas XG-Boost imparts the most optimized response having an accuracy of 90.18% while performing automated tuning of parameters.
